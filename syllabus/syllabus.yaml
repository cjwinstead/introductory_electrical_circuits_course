homework: |
  Weekly problems will be assigned from the textbook. They will usually be assigned
  on Mondays and due the following Monday. Problems should be worked out on engineering
  paper; writing and diagrams should be clear and legible; final answers should be boxed
  or underlined (see attached homework template). **In each assignment, you must correctly
  solve five problems for full credit.** Your first five correct solutions are worth 20
  points each; you can submit additional correct solutions for 5 points extra credit each.
  Homework should be scanned and uploaded on Canvas. Late homework is accepted up to one
  week after the due date with no penalty. Homework can be turned in up to one week late
  without penalty, or up to two weeks late with a 10% penalty.
tests: |
  There will be two midterms and one final exam. Exams will be taken in-class or via the
  testing center. Students are permitted to bring one 8.5x11 sheet of notes for each midterm,
  and three sheets for the final.
labs: |
  There are seven lab assignments. Each assignment is split into three parts: pre-lab tasks,
  experimental methods, and post-lab report. Pre-lab tasks and exercises should be completed
  during the week prior to the lab experiment. Experiments should be conducted during your
  scheduled lab session unless special permission is granted by the instructor. The post-lab
  report should be completed as soon as possible after the experiments are done. Approximately
  two weeks are allocated to each lab assignment.
grade_policy: |
  YOU MUST COMPLETE ALL LABS TO PASS THE COURSE. You don't have to get a perfect
  score, but you do need to perform all of the experiments. Extra credit points
  will generally be applied within their category, i.e. homework points add to your
  homework score but cannot make up for a missing lab assignment.

objectives:
  - 'Student shall understand circuit fundamentals, including Ohm’s law, Kirchoff’s current and voltage laws, and power conservation laws.'
  - 'Students shall have the ability to write loop-current and node-voltage equations for arbitrary networks comprised of resistors, capacitors, inductors, dependent and independent sources. They shall be able to solve DC circuits for arbitrary currents and voltages.'
  - 'Students shall develop the ability to formulate Norton and Thevenin equivalent circuits at an arbitrary one-port circuit interface for arbitrarly complex networks that include dependent and independent sources.'
  - 'Students shall develop the ability to solve for currents, voltages and power in circuits containing ideal op-amps in inverting, non-inverting, summing and differencing configurations. They shall develop the ability to design op-amp circuits using superposition principles.'
  - 'Students shall develop the ability to find time constants, initial and final values and the complete responses for first-order RC and RL circuits containing switches, step, or pulse sources.'
  - 'Shall develop the ability to use lab instruments including oscilloscopes, power supplies, multimeters and function generators.'
  - 'Shall develop the ability to use circuit simulation and analysis software for DC and transient analysis.'
