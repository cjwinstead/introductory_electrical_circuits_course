statement: |
  The circuit below contains three resistors connected in two
  branches. The resistors are $R_1=\SI{3}{\kilo\ohm}$, $R_2 =
  \SI{3}{\kilo\ohm}$, and $R_3=\SI{6}{\kilo\ohm}$. A voltage is
  applied between nodes A and B, $v_{AB}=\SI{6}{\volt}$ (voltage
  source not shown in the diagram).  Answer the questions that follow.
parts:
  - question: |
      What is the total equivalent resistance between A and B?
    solution: |
      $\SI{3}{\kilo\ohm}$
  - question: |
      What are the branch currents $i_1$ and $i_3$?
    solution: |
      Both $\SI{1}{\milli\ampere}$
  - question: |
      What is the total current $i_s$?
    solution: |
      $\SI{2}{\milli\ampere}$
