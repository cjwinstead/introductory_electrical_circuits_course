figure: "johnny"
points: 20
statement: |
   Johnny is experimenting with high voltage sources in the lab
   today. He hasn't had any safety training but feels confident 
   in his own instincts. While moving wires around, Johnny touches
   the terminals of an active power supply sustaining $\SI{10}{\kilo\volt}$
   between nodes A and B, as illustrated in the figure below. Answer the questions that 
   follow.
parts:
  - question: |
      During his last moments, Johnny observes that the power supply
      current is $\SI{3}{\ampere}$. How much power is Johnny's body
      absorbing?
    solution: |
      $P=\SI{30}{\kilo\watt}$
  - question: |
      While Johnny is immobilized by the electric current, he passes
      the time by estimating his own body's electrical resistance. How
      many Ohms does Johnny have?
    solution: |
      $R_\text{Johnny} = \SI{3.3}{\kilo\ohm}$
  - question: |
      Johnny suddenly realizes several things he could have done to
      avoid this situation. Name something that would have improved
      lab safety.
    solution: |
      Any reasonable answer.
