statement: |
   Four resistors are connected in parallel as shown. Answer the questions below. Resistor values are indicated separately in each sub-question.
parts:
  - question: |
      What is the equivalent resistance if all resistors are equal to
      $\SI{4}{\kilo\ohm}$?
    solution: |
      $\SI{1}{\kilo\ohm}$
  - question: |
      What is the equivalent resistance if $R_1=\SI{1}{\kilo\ohm}$,
      $R_2=\SI{10}{\kilo\ohm}$, $R_3=\SI{100}{\kilo\ohm}$, and
      $R_4=\SI{1}{\mega\ohm}$? Round your answer to the nearest
      $\si{\kilo\ohm}$.
    solution: |
      $\SI{1}{\kilo\ohm}$
  - question: |
      What is the equivalent resistance if the *conductances* are $G_1
      = \SI{300}{\micro\siemens}$, $G_2 = \SI{100}{\micro\siemens}$,
      $G_3 = \SI{400}{\micro\siemens}$, and $G_4 =
      \SI{200}{\micro\siemens}$?
    solution: |
      $\SI{1}{\kilo\ohm}$
