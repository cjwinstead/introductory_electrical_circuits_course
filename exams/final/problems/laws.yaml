statement: |
   The problems below relate to the basic laws of electric circuits
   containing sources and resistors. Your solutions may require use of
   any analysis concepts learned in this course. 
parts:
# --------- Voltage Divider ------------------------
  - question: |
      A contact sensor changes resistance when touched. In the
      schematic below, the contact resistance is **initially**
      $R_C=\SI{1}{\mega\ohm}$, and the output voltage is
      $V_{BC}=\SI{4.5}{\volt}$. When touched, the resistance
      **changes** to $R_C=\SI{1}{\kilo\ohm}$. What is the final output
      voltage at $V_{BC}$?       
    figure: "`contact_sensor.tex`{=latex}"
    solution: |
       $R_C$ combines in parallel with the $\SI{100}{\kilo\ohm}$
       resistor, for a combined resistance of $\SI{990.1}{\ohm}$. Then
       we have a voltage divider so that
       $V_{BC}=\SI{5}{\volt}\times\SI{990.1}{\ohm}/\left(\SI{990.1}{\ohm}+\SI{10}{\kilo\ohm}\right)=\SI{0.45}{\volt}$. 
# --------- Node Voltage ------------------------
  - question: |
      A portion of a circuit is shown below. Given
      $i_1=\SI{1}{\milli\ampere}$, 
      $i_2=\SI{666}{\micro\ampere}$, and $v_B=\SI{1}{\volt}$, what is
      the voltage at node C?  
    figure: "`kcl_ohm.tex`{=latex}"
    solution: |
      This circuit is equivalent to a current divider: the entering
      current at the node is $i=1mA$, and the exiting currents are
      $i2R/(R+2R)=(2/3)i$ and $iR/(R+2R)=(1/3)i$. In a current
      divider, the two resistors are arranged in parallel, so the
      potential at $v_C$ must be the same as the potential at $v_B$.
      Therefore $v_C = \SI{1}{\volt}$.
# --------- KCL or Mesh Currents ------------------------
  - question: |
       In the circuit shown, the indicated current is
       $i=\SI{1}{\milli\ampere}$. Determine the voltage at node M.
    figure: "`kcl_loop.tex`{=latex}"
    solution: |
      The currents all flow in a loop through the current sources. At
      each node, the total entering current is $i$ and the total
      exiting current is also $i$. There is no surplus current
      available for the resistor branches, so they all have zero
      current and zero voltage drop. The center voltage is therefore
      zero volts.
# --------- Superposition ------------------------
  - question: |
       In this circuit, the voltage at node B is
       $v_B=\SI{2}{\volt}$. Now suppose an independent current source
       is connected between nodes B and C as indicated. Given that
       $R=\SI{1}{\kilo\ohm}$ and $I=\SI{1}{\milli\ampere}$, what is
       the voltage at node B after inserting the current source?
    figure: "`superposition.tex`{=latex}"
    solution: |
      By the principle of superposition, to analyze the contribution
      from the current source we can begin by setting the voltage
      source to zero, making it a short circuit. Then the two
      resistors are in parallel with a combined resistance of R/2. The
      added voltage is 
      $IR/2=\SI{0.5}{\volt}$, so the final voltage at node B is
      $\SI{2.5}{\volt}$.
