  These problems deal with capacitors and inductors in various
  configurations. 
parts:
# --------- Supercapacitor ------------------------
  - question: |
      A 100F supercapacitor is charged to an initial voltage of
      27V. One terminal of the capacitor is connected to ground as
      shown. Suppose you grab the other terminal (node A) with your
      hand while your bare foot is standing on the ground. The
      grabbing occurs at time zero, and is illustrated schematically
      by a switch. If your
      body has a resistance of $\SI{1}{\kilo\ohm}$, what will be the
      peak current passing through you? How long will it take for the
      current to drop to a "safe" level of 10mA?
    figure: "`supercapacitor.tex`{=latex}"
    solution: |
       The peak current is at time zero, equal to 27mA. In order to
       drop to 10mA, the RC circuit must discharge 63% of the
       capacitor's charge. This happens in $\tau=RC=10^5$ seconds, or
       1,667 minutes, about 27.8 hours.
# --------- Charge ------------------------
  - question: |-
      Suppose the same amount of charge, $Q=1$ **pico Coulomb**, is stored
      in three different capacitors. For each case, calculate the
      voltage across the capacitor and the energy stored in the
      capacitor.      
      * $\SI{1}{\pico\farad}$
      * $\SI{1}{\nano\farad}$
      * $\SI{1}{\micro\farad}$      
      $~$      
    solution: |
      Since capacitance is Coulombs per Volt, we have $V=Q/C$. Then
      the energy is $\frac{1}{2}CV^2$ or $\frac{1}{2}Q^2/C$. For the
      three cases:
      * $V=Q/C = 1$V, $E=0.5$pJ
      * $V = 1$mV, $E=0.5$fJ
      * $V = 1\mu$V, $E=0.5$aJ
# --------- Switched Inductor ------------------------
  - question: |
      In this circuit, the switch is initially closed, so that $R_1$
      and $R_2$ are connected in parallel. At time $t=0$, the switch
      is opened, so that only $R_2$ is connected across the
      inductor. What is the voltage $v_B$ just after switching at
      time $t=0$? **Recall that the current in an inductor cannot
      change instantaneously.**
    figure: "`switched_inductor.tex`{=latex}"
    solution: |
      Prior to time zero, the total current is $i_\ell = 1/(10) +
      1/1000) = \SI{0.101}{\ampere}$. When the switch opens, the
      current doesn't change instantly, so it's still
      $\SI{0.101}{\ampere}$. All the current flows through $R_2$
      yielding a voltage $i_\ell R_2 = \SI{101}{\volt}$. 
# --------- Steady State ------------------------
  - question: |
      This circuit is operating at steady-state. No signals are
      changing. Determine every voltage and current.
    figure: "`steady_state.tex`{=latex}"
    solution: |
      Node A is forced by the voltage source so
      $v_a=\SI{1}{\volt}$. At steady-state, the inductor acts like a
      short-circuit, so $v_C=v_A=\SI{1}{\volt}$, and
      $i_1=v_C/R_1=\SI{1}{\milli\ampere}$. The capacitor acts like an
      open-circuit, so $i_3=0$, therefore $R_2$ and $R_4$ act like a
      series combination equal to $\SI{1}{\kilo\ohm}$, so
      $i_2=i_4=\SI{1}{\milli\ampere}$. To detemine $v_B$, notice that
      $R_2$ and $R_4$ form a voltage divider with equal resistors, so
      $v_B=v_A/2=\SI{0.5}{\volt}$. Lastly, since $i_3=0$ there is no
      voltage change across $R_3$, so
      $v_D=v_B=\SI{0.5}{\volt}$.
