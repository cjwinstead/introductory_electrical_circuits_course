description: 'Op Amp Configurations'
points: 40
statement: |
  These problems assume an ideal op amp with $A\rightarrow \infty$ and
  power rails at $\pm\infty$.
parts:
# --------- Voltage Divider ------------------------
  - question: |
      An op amp is connected in a negative-feedback configuration as
      shown. What is the output voltage? (Notice that all of the
      signals are constant, nothing is changing with time).
    figure: "`follower.tex`{=latex}"
    solution: |
       The resistor, inductor and capacitor have no effect on the
       steady-state solution for this circuit. It is just a voltage
       follower, so the output is 2V. 
# --------- Superposition Inverting/Non-Inverting -----------------
  - question: |
      An op amp is connected in a negative-feedback configuration as
      shown. What is the output voltage? 
    figure: "`opamp_superposition.tex`{=latex}"
    solution: |
       This circuit is a superposition of inverting configuration
       (gain of -3) and a non-inverting configuration (gain of 4). The
       combined output is $4(-2)-3(1)=-11$V.
# --------- Difference Amplifier -----------------
  - question: |
      An op amp is connected in a difference configuration as
      shown. What is the output voltage? 
    figure: "`difference.tex`{=latex}"
    solution: |
       The output should be $3(2-(-1))=9$V.
# --------- Input Current -----------------
  - question: |
      An op amp is connected in a negative feedback configuration as
      shown. What is the current $i_2$?
    figure: "`opamp_input_current.tex`{=latex}"
    solution: |
      Zero. Due to the op amp's virtual short effect, the op amp's
      input terminals are at the same potential, so there is no
      voltage change across the resistor. Therefore it cannot have any
      current.
